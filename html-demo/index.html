       <p>Decomposition is the process in which the organs and complex molecules of animal and human bodies break down into simple organic matter over time. In vertebrates, five stages of decomposition are typically recognized: fresh, bloat, active decay, advanced decay, and dry/skeletonized. Knowing the different stages of decomposition can help investigators in determining the post-mortem interval (PMI). The rate of decomposition of human remains can vary due to environmental factors and other factors. Environmental factors include temperature, burning, humidity, and the availability of oxygen. Other factors include body size, clothing, and the cause of death.</p>
       <h2>Stages and Characteristics</h2>
        <p>The five stages of decomposition—fresh (autolysis), bloat, active decay, advanced decay, and dry/skeletonized—have specific characteristics that are used to identify which stage the remains are in. These stages are illustrated by reference to an experimental study of the decay of a pig corpse.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fresh - At this stage the remains are usually intact and free of insects. </li>
            <li>Bloat - At this stage, the microorganisms residing in the digestive system begin to digest the tissues of the body, excreting gases that cause the torso and limbs to bloat, and producing foul-smelling chemicals.</li>
            <li>Active Decay - At this stage, the tissues begin to liquify and the skin will start to blacken.</li>
            <li>Advanced Decay - During advanced decay, most of the remains have discolored and often blackened. Putrefaction, in which tissues and cells break down and liquidize as the body decays, will be almost complete.</li>
            <li>Dry/Skelatonized Remains - Once bloating has ceased, the soft tissue of remains typically collapses in on itself. At the end of active decay, the remains are often dried out and begin to skeletonize.</li>
        </ol>
